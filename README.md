# D-optimal Data Fusion:Exact and Approximation Algorithms

This project contains the implementations of exact and approximation algorithms for solving D-optimal Data Fusion (DDF) tested on IEEE-118 bus instance.

Specifically, we implement the greedy, local search and randomized sampling algorithms, which correspond to files greedy.py, local_search.py and sampling.py in the "approximation algorithms" folder, respectively. 

Furthermore, we implement the Branch-and-Bound algorithm along with optimality cuts to solve DDF to optimality,  which correspond to files branch_and_bound.py, optcut.py in the "exact Branch-and-Bound algorithm" folder, respectively.

For our paper "D-optimal Data Fusion:Exact and Approximation Algorithms", and detailed implementation of the algorithms, see: https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.03589
